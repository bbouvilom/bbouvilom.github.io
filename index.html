                <p>
                    Hello and welcome to my page, I was born and raised in Kansas City.
                    <p>My parents, both immigrants from Laos came here to the United States looking for better opportunity.</p>
                    <p>I basically grew up outside, always playing some sport or just wandering off into the woods; absolutely hated being</p><p> inside.</p>
                    <p>As I got older and matured, I started to figure out what hobbies I truly enjoyed and things that brought me joy- </p><p>mechanics, technology and</p>
                    <p>fabrication; combined! I then started working on automobiles and motorcycles, tearing them down and rebuilding them</p><p>from the ground up as well </p>
                    <p>as dissecting the inner workings of their brains/computers that ran them. All very fascinating to me and to this day I am still so intruiged by all of it.</p> 
                   <p> My thoughts are that someday I will be able to create something whether it be a vehicle or some sort of automated machine that
                    will somehow benefit</p> <p>our ever evolving world.
                </p>
